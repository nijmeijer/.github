# Welcome to the SystemRDL open source community!

The goal of this GitHub organization is to build high-quality free and
open-source tools for control & status register (CSR) automation, and to
promote [Accellera's SystemRDL](https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemrdl)
as the language of choice for CSR design entry. [^1]


## PeakRDL Command Line Application
PeakRDL is a command-line application that provides a ready-to-use register
automation toolchain.

See the [PeakRDL Documentation](http://peakrdl.readthedocs.io) for more details.


## Individual PeakRDL Components
If the command line tool isn't your style, you can use the PeakRDL components
individually. Each component is installable as a separate Python package and has
a documented API you can use to integrate it into your own custom workflow.

* [PeakRDL-regblock](https://peakrdl-regblock.readthedocs.io) generates synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL.
* [PeakRDL-html](https://github.com/SystemRDL/PeakRDL-html/blob/main/README.md) produces intuitive and dynamic HTML documentation.
* [PeakRDL-uvm](https://github.com/SystemRDL/PeakRDL-uvm/blob/main/README.md) generates a UVM register model.
* [PeakRDL-ipxact](https://peakrdl-ipxact.readthedocs.io) lets you import and export IP-XACT XML.

Be sure to also check out the growing list of tools [others in the community](community_plugins.md) have made.

## SystemRDL language front-end compiler
Need to build something custom? Don't [invent your own](https://xkcd.com/927/)
janky input format - Use SystemRDL! The SystemRDL compiler front-end handles all
the heavy-lifting of processing the SystemRDL language so you don't have to.
The compiler provides a rich and intuitive Python API that you can use for your
own custom register automation.

See the [SystemRDL Compiler Documentation](http://systemrdl-compiler.readthedocs.io)
for more details.
